## MDI version  
this is the verctor version of MD.  
### performance  
1. about 10 times faster `-y 0` than `-y 1`
2. MDI be little fater 10% than MD1? (revised by virial estimitor, otherwise slower than 20%?) (why?)
3. MDI running time is still about 3 times than spimd

### conclusion  
the vectorization doesn't reach expection!
